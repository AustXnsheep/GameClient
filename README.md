**Game Client for my future multi-player vr projects**

How does this work?
This is a simple client that using Lwjgl, Log4j, Jackson, LibGDX, and lwjfl-openvr

This client can join the server I've setup using DigitalOcean, and lets you see other "players" active in it.

Controls:
Mouse: controls where you're looking
W: go forwards
S: go backwards
F: Pushes all blocks on the server upwards, is visible for every other player.

This whole project was more for a learning experience but I am planning to use this to make a vr game.
